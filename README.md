  <h1>Samurai Taxi Frontend</h1>

  <p>This repository contains the frontend codebase for the Samurai Taxi app. It is built using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, and utilizes the Google Maps API for displaying and interacting with maps.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>The Samurai Taxi frontend is a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the app and request taxi services. It utilizes the power of Vue.js and Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless experience. The Google Maps API integration enables the display of maps, route calculation, and real-time tracking.</p>

  <p>To use the app, follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sign up or log in to your Samurai Taxi account.</li>
    <li>Enter your pickup location and destination.</li>
    <li>View available drivers on the map.</li>
    <li>Select a driver and confirm your ride request.</li>
    <li>Track the driver's location in real-time as they approach your pickup location.</li>
    <li>Once the ride is complete, provide a rating and feedback for the driver.</li>
  </ol>
